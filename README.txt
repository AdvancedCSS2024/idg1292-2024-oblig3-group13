Points discussed during brainstorming:

Project overview and purpose:
The purpose of this project is to highlight the biggest problems regarding fast fashion. 
The first major problem is the amount of waste that is produced, due to the trend cycle being shorter than ever (52 cycles every year, e.g. 
once a week) and the poor quality of the clothing produced. The trend cycles being shorter causes people to throw away their clothes due to 
them no longer being on trend. Even if you were to keep your clothes longer than a trend cycle, it’ll might fall apart due to the poor quality 
and craftsmanship. The poor quality is almost a requirement, so that the garment will be cheaper to produce and have a low sales price.

The second major problem comes from one of the other factors that causes the clothing to be cheap; the sweatshops and the pay of the people 
who work there. Sweatshops are dingy factories with poor working conditions which often causes serios health problems for their workers. The 
workers are paid as good as null and void, for about 2,18 kroner an hour, during gruelling work hours that’s sometimes in stretches of 72 
hours without sleep (https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/consumption/clothing/sweatshop-facts ). Sometimes the pay is docked or they 
have to pay a fine if a garment is sewed incorrectly or not produced fast enough. A lot of young poor children are forced to work under these 
conditions, instead of going to school, due to their family’s circumstance. This is not only an environmental issue, but also a human rights 
issue.

A lot of the brands that we shop our clothes from are fast fashion, and sometimes we aren’t aware of it. Some of them presents themselves as 
a mid luxury brand, like Zara. Others are cheap enough for everyday people to get the clothes they need, but expensive enough for us to 
believe that the people that makes the clothes earn a liveable wage, like H&M. Some are more obvious, like Shein.

Instructions for getting started:

General process:
We started by choosing our UN goal. We thought about both woman rights and responsible use and production (insert UN goals) and ended up on 
UN goal 12. We thought about making a story of plastic waste, but ended up at fast fashion. One could also think about how much plastic is in 
our clothing (polyester, nylon, elastane, acrylic, etc.). We first made a storyboard of a t-shirt and the fast fashion process it goes through, 
where the t-shirt would have a sticky effect. We still have a t-shirt in all of the stages, but it isn’t following the story of one singular 
t-shirt. Vilja then made a lot of SVGs, like the landfill with the tractor and the city of factories and the children. Some of the SVGs and 
some singular parts of the SVGs where then animated in a motion sensitivity friendly way (no abrupt or unexpected movements).
